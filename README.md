# ENIGMA_Lesion_Load_Comparison

This repo contains the code used to analyze data for "Optimizing the Approach to Calculating CST Lesion Load in Ischemic Stroke Patients for Understanding Motor Outcomes" by Williamson et al. (In Progress). The code is still in its original form but the authors are working to reformat so that it can be used for other related projects.
